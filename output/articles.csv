"How feminism, not Bollywood, drew global audiences to Indian cinema in 2024",15 hours ago,Yasser Usman,Film writer,"['In 2024, as Bollywood struggled to find its footing, smaller films by Indian women that told nuanced stories made headlines in the country and across the world.In May, Indian filmmaker Payal Kapadia\'s All We Imagine As Light made history by winning the Grand Prix at the Cannes film festival.In the months since then, All We Imagine As Light has become a juggernaut of indie cinema, sweeping through film festivals and the awards circuit. It has been judged the Best International film by prestigious associations including the New York Film Critics Circle and the Toronto Film Critics Association. It has also picked up two Golden Globe nominations, including for Ms Kapadia as best director. It is also on several best films of the year list, including that of the BBC and the New York Times.And it has company. Director Shuchi Talati\'s coming-of-age drama Girls Will Be Girls won two awards at the Sundance Film Festival. Kiran Rao\'s Laapataa Ladies (Lost Ladies) spent at least two months on the top 10 list of Netflix in India and was picked as the country\'s official Oscar entry (a controversial decision). Laapataa Ladies didn\'t make it to the Academy\'s shortlist. What did make it was British-Indian director Sandhya Suri\'s Hindi film Santosh, which had been picked as the UK\'s submission to the Oscars.Is this sudden wave of success for Indian films an aberration or a long-awaited shift in global consciousness? ""It\'s a culmination of both,"" says film critic Shubhra Gupta, pointing out that these films were not ""made overnight"".For instance, Shuchi Talati, the director of Girls Will Be Girls, and its co-producer Richa Chadha were in college together when they first came up with the idea for the film. ""They have been working on it for years,"" Gupta says. ""It\'s pure serendipity that 2024 became the year these films were released, igniting conversations together.""', 'This fortunate alignment has been a cinematic dream. The global impact of these films is rooted in their quality and exploration of universal themes like loneliness, relationships, identity, gender and resilience. With strong female voices and unconventional feminist narratives, these stories venture into territories unexplored by mainstream Indian cinema.In All We Imagine As Light, a film made in the Hindi, Marathi and Malayalam languages, three migrant women in Mumbai navigate empathy, resilience and human connection. The narrative delves into themes of loneliness and the socio-political landscape, notably the scrutiny of interfaith Hindu-Muslim relationships as seen with the character Anu (Divya Prabha) and her bond with Shiaz (Hridhu Haroon).Kapadia told the BBC that while the women in her films are financially independent, they still face limitations in their personal lives, particularly when it comes to matters of love. ""For me, love in India is very political… women seem to hold a lot of the so-called honour of the family and the protection of the caste lineage. So if she marries somebody who is of a different religion or of a different caste, that becomes an issue. For me, it is really a method to control women and infantilise them,"" she says.Talati\'s Girls Will Be Girls explores female adolescence, rebellion and intergenerational conflict through the story of a 16-year-old girl studying at a strict boarding school in the Himalayas and her fractured relationship with her mother, Anila, who struggles with her own vulnerabilities and unresolved emotions.""It is the kind of coming-of-age film that we don\'t do in India at all,"" Gupta says. ""It looks at women from a very empathetic, very warm gaze.""""The age where people experience emotions with and without their bodies, their minds, that exploration but without infantilising the experience - it was never part of Indian mainstream cinema,"" she adds.', 'Kiran Rao\'s Laapataa Ladies did not perform well at the box-office but got warm reviews from viewers and critics. At a BAFTA screening in London this month, Ms Rao described the current moment as ""really special for women from India"", expressing hope for a continued wave of such stories. Her film is a satirical comedy about two newlywed brides getting accidentally swapped on a train because of their veils. It offers a sharp commentary on patriarchy, identity and gender roles, a shift from decades of male-centred mainstream Indian films.""A lot of us who are very patriarchal in our thinking are often that way because that\'s how we have been brought up,"" Bollywood star Aamir Khan, a co-producer of the film, said after the screening. ""But we need to be understanding, at least try and help each other even to come out of this kind of thinking.""The biggest surprise this year came from the UK, which selected the Hindi-language film Santosh, directed by British-Indian filmmaker Sandhya Suri, as its Oscar entry. Shot entirely in India over a 44-day schedule, it featured a largely female crew. Starring Indian actors Shahana Goswami and Sunita Rajbhar, Santosh was co-produced by people and companies across the UK, India, Germany and France.The film is intrinsically an Indian story about violence against women, set as a taut thriller.Goswami says the success of Santosh and All We Imagine as Light points to the merging of borders and expansion of film industries, creating space for cross-pollination and exchange. ""We often think these Indian films require [specific] cultural context, but they don\'t. Any film driven by emotion will resonate universally, regardless of its origins,"" she told the BBC.', 'Three of the films - All We Imagine as Light, Girls Will Be Girls and Santosh - share one more common trait: they are cross-country co-productions. Goswami agrees that this could this be a formula for the future. ""With a French producer, for example, a film gains the opportunity to be seen by a French audience who may follow that producer or the broader film industry. This is how it becomes more globally accessible and relevant,"" she says.Even in Bollywood, some women-led films have had huge success this year. Stree 2, a horror-comedy about a mysterious woman battling a monster who abducts free-thinking women, was the year\'s second-biggest hit, playing in cinemas for months. On streaming platforms, Sanjay Leela Bhansali\'s opulent Netflix series Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar, an exploration of the misogyny and exploitation in the lives of courtesans in pre-independent India, was among Google\'s top-searched TV shows of the year. Their success seems to signal a growing appetite for such stories, their broad appeal demonstrating that mainstream cinema can address important themes without sacrificing entertainment value.Despite systemic challenges, 2024 has highlighted the global power of female voices from India and the demand for diverse stories. The momentum could be crucial for the Indian film industry in getting wider distribution for its independent films and pave the way for a more diverse and equitable film landscape.']"
"New elections could take up to four years, Syria rebel leader says",,BBC News,Member of BBC News. Name not available,"['Holding new elections in Syria could take up to four years, rebel leader Ahmed al-Sharaa has said in a broadcast interview.This is the first time he has given a timeline for possible elections in Syria since his group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) led a rebel offensive that ousted former President Bashar al-Assad.In the interview with Saudi state broadcaster Al Arabiya on Sunday, he said drafting a new constitution could take up to three years.He said it could also be a year before Syrians begin to see significant change and improvements to public services following the overthrow of the Assad regime.', 'Sharaa said Syria needed to rebuild its legal system and would have to hold a comprehensive population census to run legitimate elections.Sharaa - previously known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani - has led the country\'s new  authorities after the Assad presidency fell earlier this month.Since then, questions have been raised over how HTS will govern the multi-ethnic country.HTS began as a jihadist group - espousing violence to achieve its goal of establishing a state governed by Islamic law (Sharia) - but has distanced itself from that past in recent years. Sharaa said the group, which was once aligned with Islamic State and al- Qaeda and is designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN and many countries, will be ""dissolved"" at an upcoming national dialogue conference but gave no further details.The gathering could be the first test of whether Syria\'s new leadership can achieve the promised goal of uniting the country after thirteen years of civil war.Responding to criticism of his transitional government, he said the appointments made were ""essential"" and not meant to exclude anyone.Syria is home to many ethnic and religious groups, including Kurds, Armenians, Assyrians, Christians, Druze, Alawite Shia and Arab Sunnis, the last of whom make up a majority of the Muslim population.His group have promised to protect the rights and freedoms of minorities in the country.', 'Meanwhile, nearly 300 people have been arrested in the past week in a crackdown on Assad loyalists, according to a UK-based war monitor.Those arrested include informants, pro-regime fighters and former soldiers, Syrian Observatory for Human Rights head Rami Abdel Rahman said.He told AFP news agency the arrests had been taking place ""with the cooperation of local populations"".Syrian state news agency Sana also reported arrests this week targeting ""Assad militia members"" where weapons and ammunition were seized.']"
"As Putin reaches 25 years in power, has he 'taken care of Russia'?",,BBC News,Member of BBC News. Name not available,"['I will never forget New Year\'s Eve 1999.I was working as a producer in the BBC\'s Moscow bureau. Suddenly there was breaking news: Russia\'s President Boris Yeltsin had stepped down.His decision to resign took everyone by surprise, including the British press corps in Moscow. When the news broke there was no correspondent in the office. That meant I had to step in to write and broadcast my first BBC dispatch.""Boris Yeltsin always said he would see out his full term in office,"" I wrote. ""Today he told Russians he\'d changed his mind.""It was the start of my career as a reporter.And the start of Vladimir Putin\'s as Russia\'s leader.Following Yeltsin\'s resignation, in accordance with the Russian constitution, Prime Minister Putin became acting president. Three months later he won the election.On leaving the Kremlin, Yeltsin\'s parting instruction to Putin was: ""Take care of Russia!""', 'I\'ve found myself recalling these words of Yeltsin more and more, the closer Russia\'s war on Ukraine gets to the three-year mark.That\'s because President Putin\'s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has had devastating consequences.Primarily for Ukraine, which has seen massive destruction and casualties in its cities. Almost 20% of its territory has been occupied and 10 million of its citizens have been displaced.But for Russia, too:Since Vladimir Putin\'s decision to launch his so-called ""special military operation"" Russia has sustained heavy losses on the battlefieldRussian towns and cities come under regular drone attackUkrainian soldiers have occupied a part of Russia\'s Kursk regionInternational sanctions are heaping pressure on Russia\'s economyWhat\'s more, the country\'s demographic situation is direDomestic repression has picked up apaceI\'ve been reporting on Putin since he came to power a quarter of a century ago.On 31 December 1999, who would have thought that Russia\'s new leader would still be in power two and a half decades later? Or that Russia today would be waging war on Ukraine and facing off with the West?', 'I often wonder whether the course of history would have been drastically different if Yeltsin had picked someone else to succeed him. The question, of course, is academic. History is full of ifs and buts and maybes.One thing I can say with certainty: over twenty-five years I\'ve seen different Putins.And I\'m not the only one.""The Putin I met with, did good business with, established a Nato-Russia Council with, is very, very different from this almost megalomaniac at the present moment,"" former Nato chief Lord Robertson told me in 2023.""The man who stood beside me in May 2002, right beside me, and said Ukraine is a sovereign and independent nation state which will make its own decisions about security, is now the man who says that [Ukraine] is not a nation state.""I think that Vladimir Putin has a very thin skin and a huge ambition for his country. The Soviet Union was recognised as the second superpower in the world. Russia can\'t make any claims in that direction. And I think that ate away at his ego.""That is one possible explanation for the change we\'ve seen in Putin: his burning ambition to ""Make Russia Great Again"" (and to make up for what many perceive as Moscow\'s defeat in the Cold War) put Russia on an inevitable collision course with its neighbours – and with the West.The Kremlin has a different explanation. From the speeches he gives, the comments he makes, Putin appears driven by resentment, by an all-encompassing feeling that for years Russia has been lied to and disrespected, its security concerns dismissed by the West.But does Putin himself believe that he has fulfilled Yeltsin\'s request to ""take care of Russia?""I recently had a chance to find out.', 'More than four hours into his lengthy end-of-year press conference, Putin invited me to ask a question.""Boris Yeltsin told you to take care of Russia,"" I reminded the president. ""But what of the significant losses in your so-called \'special military operation\', the Ukrainian troops in Kursk region, the sanctions, the high inflation. Do you think you\'ve taken care of your country?""""Yes,"" President Putin replied. ""And I haven\'t just taken care of it. We\'ve pulled back from the edge of the abyss.""He portrayed Yeltsin\'s Russia as a country that had been losing its sovereignty. He accused the West of having ""patronisingly patted"" Yeltsin on the shoulder while ""using Russia for its own purposes"". But he, Putin, was ""doing everything"", he said, ""to ensure Russia was an independent sovereign state"".Presenting himself as the defender of Russian sovereignty: is this a view he\'s come up with retrospectively to try to justify the war in Ukraine? Or does Putin really believe this take on modern Russian history?I\'m still not sure. Not yet. But I sense that it is a key question.The answer to it may well influence how the war ends - and Russia\'s future direction.']"
Did bird strike contribute to South Korea plane crash? What we know so far,2 hours ago,BBC News,Member of BBC News. Name not available,"['More than 170 people have died after a plane crashed as it was landing in South Korea on Sunday morning.The Jeju Air plane came off the runway before colliding with a wall at Muan International Airport in the south west of the country.The plane, which was returning from Bangkok, in Thailand, was carrying 181 people - 179 of whom have died, while two crew members were rescued from the wreckage.Authorities are investigating the cause of the crash, which fire officials have indicated may have occurred due to a bird strike and bad weather. However experts have warned the crash could have been caused by a number of factors.', 'The flight, 7C2216, was a Boeing 737-800 operated by Jeju Air, Korea\'s most popular budget airline.The plane arrived in Muan at about 09:00 local time (00:00 GMT).A South Korean transport official said that the plane had been attempting to land but was forced to hold off after air traffic control gave a bird strike warning - an alert about the risk of a collision with birds. About two minutes later, the pilot called in a Mayday and air traffic command gave permission for the plane to land from the opposite direction, the official said.One passenger on the flight messaged a relative, saying that a bird ""was stuck in the wing"" and that the plane could not land, local media reported.One video appears to show the plane touching down without using its wheels or any other landing gear. It skidded down the runway and crashed into a wall before erupting into flames.A witness told the South Korean news agency Yonhap that they heard a ""loud bang"" followed by a ""series of explosions"".Videos from the scene show the plane ablaze with smoke billowing into the sky. Fire crews have since extinguished the fire. Lee Jeong-hyun, the chief of the Muan fire department, told a televised briefing that the tail section of the plane was identifiable but ""one cannot recognise the shape of the rest of the plane"".He said that the bird strike and bad weather may have caused the crash - but that the exact cause is still being investigated. The flight and voice recorders from the plane have been recovered.The head of Jeju Air\'s management said that the crash was not due to ""any maintenance issues"", the Yonhap news agency reported.The South Korean transport department said that the head pilot on the flight had held the role since 2019 and had more than 6,800 hours of flight experience.', ""A bird strike is a collision between a plane in flight and a bird. They are very common - in the UK, there were more than 1,400 bird strikes reported in 2022, only about 100 of which affected the plane, according to data from the Civil Aviation Authority.The best known bird strike occurred in 2009, when an Airbus plane ditched into New York's Hudson River after colliding with a flock of geese. All 155 passengers and crew survived.Professor Doug Drury, who teaches aviation at CQUniversity Australia, wrote in an article for The Conversation this summer that Boeing planes have turbofan engines, which can be severely damaged in a bird strike. He said that pilots are trained to be especially vigilant during the early morning or at sunset, when birds are most active."", ""The plane was carrying 175 passengers and six crew. Two of the passengers were Thai and the rest are believed to have been South Korean, authorities have said. Many are thought to have been returning from a Christmas holiday in Thailand.The official death toll stands at 179 - making it the deadliest plane crash in South Korean history. All the passengers and four members of crew died.Authorities have so far identified at least 88 bodies.Five of the people who died were children under the age of 10. The youngest passenger was a three-year-old boy and the oldest was 78, authorities said, citing the passenger manifest.South Korea's National Fire Agency said two members of flight crew - a man and a woman - survived the crash. They were found in the tail side of the aircraft after the crash and taken to hospital, it said.More than 1,500 emergency personnel have been deployed as part of recovery efforts, including 490 fire employees and 455 police officers. They have been searching the area around the runway for parts of the plane and those who were onboard."", 'Acting President Choi Sang-mok has declared a special disaster zone in Muan, which makes central government funding available to the local government and victims.All flights to and from Muan International Airport have been cancelled.Families of the victims of the crash have been travelling to the airport in the hope of finding out what happened to their relatives. Video footage from Reuters shows officials reading names of the victims out loud.', 'Airport authorities and the Red Cross have set up more than a dozen tents in the airport for bereaved families to grieve in private. Sounds of crying echoed through the terminal. Some are frustrated at how long it is taking to identify the bodies.Jeju Air has apologised to families. Its chief executive said in a news conference that the airline had no history of accidents. It is believed that Sunday\'s crash has been the only fatal accident since the airline was launched in 2005.Plane manufacturer Boeing has offered condolences to those affected.Choi, South Korea\'s acting president, said: ""I express my deepest condolences to the many victims in the incident. I will do all I can for the injured to quickly recover.""The government has declared a period of national mourning for the country for the next seven days, during which flags at government offices will be lowered.']"
Chlamydia could make koalas extinct. Can a vaccine save them in time?,1 hour ago,Tiffanie Turnbull,"BBC News, Gold Coast","['On the table, unconscious and stretched out on a pillow, Joe Mangy looks deceptively peaceful. The koala\'s watery, red-rimmed eyes are the only sign of the disease at war with his body.Tubes snarl out of a mask covering his face as a vet tech listens to his chest with a stethoscope. He is not healing as well as they had hoped.Eight days earlier, Joe Mangy – who is about two years old – was found wandering in the middle of a suburban road. Dazed and confused, eyes nearly glued shut with mucus, he was rushed here, to the Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary\'s hospital.Enveloped by rainforest on Queensland\'s Gold Coast, the park is full of koalas like this.Outside the clinic, in a ""Koala Rehab Centre"" faintly perfumed by eucalyptus leaves, is a three-year-old recovering from a hysterectomy. ""It saved her life… but she can\'t reproduce,"" the head vet Michael Payne says.Another male koala stares blankly through narrowed slits. His left tear duct is so inflamed his eyeball is barely visible.This hospital is ground zero of a grim chlamydia epidemic which is killing thousands of koalas and making even more sterile, pushing the national icons to the brink of extinction.But it\'s also at the core of desperate bid to save them with a vaccine – frustrated efforts which, after over a decade, are still tied up in regulation and running out of both time and money.', 'Even a few decades ago, spotting a koala snuggled in a backyard tree was nothing out of the ordinary. They were plentiful on the country\'s populous east coast.But in recent times the species has been in dramatic decline – in some places plummeting by 80% in just 10 years.Land clearing and urbanisation are leaving the marsupials hungry and homeless, while natural disasters are drowning or cooking them en masse.""[But] it\'s the chlamydia that shot up tremendously - almost exponentially,"" says Dr Payne, who has run the Currumbin clinic for more than 20 years.""You get days where you\'re euthanising heaps of koalas that just come in completely ravaged.""Estimates vary greatly – koalas are famously difficult to count – but some groups say as few as 50,000 of the animals are left in the wild and the species is officially listed as endangered on most of the eastern seaboard. There are now fears the animals will be extinct in some states within a generation.Dr Payne wistfully recounts ""the early days"" when his hospital only saw a handful of koalas a year. They now see 400.', 'So many come through the door that the team has started giving them two names, a vet nurse says, cradling Joe Mangy as he wakes from the anaesthetic. His last name is a nod to the state of his eyes when he first arrived, she explains.Of the top reasons koalas are brought into wildlife hospitals – vehicle strikes, pet attacks and chlamydia – the bacterial infection is the biggest and deadliest.It results in conjunctivitis for koalas like Joe Mangy, but presents as an infection of the genitals and urinary system for others. Particularly unlucky animals, get both at the same time.At its worst, the ocular form can be so bad koalas are blinded and starve to death, while the urogenital infection produces giant fluid-filled cysts so ""nasty"" everyday bodily functions like passing urine make the animals cry out in pain.""Their reproductive system falls apart,"" Dr Payne explains.If caught early enough, treatment is an option, but that in itself is a potentially fatal ""nightmare"" as the antibiotics destroy the gut bacteria which allow koalas to digest otherwise toxic eucalyptus leaves – their main food source.', 'On a species level though, the disease, which spreads through bodily fluids, causes even greater ruin.Chlamydia is not uncommon in other animals – koalas are suspected to have first caught it from livestock – but the spread and intensity of the disease amongst the marsupials is unmatched.Experts estimate around half of koalas in Queensland and New South Wales could be infected, but just a suburb away from Currumbin, in Elanora, that has climbed beyond 80%.It is the most diseased population in the region and numbers have been ""falling off a cliff"", Dr Payne says. ""It\'s a disaster.""Enter the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) and their vaccine, which aims to prevent and treat chlamydia in koalas and has been almost two decades in the making.Alongside Currumbin, they\'re trying to save the Elanora koalas from oblivion: capturing 30 youngsters and vaccinating them, before recatching them at intervals over three years to track their health.So far only three of the vaccinated koalas in this research trial have contracted the disease, though all recovered, and encouragingly, more than two dozen joeys have been born - bucking the infertility trend.""There\'s generations of koalas now that have come through. We\'ve got grand joeys,"" Dr Payne says excitedly.Currumbin has also been vaccinating every koala which comes through their hospital, and have reached about 400 koalas this way.But treating and vaccinating each koala with chlamydia costs them about A$7,000 (£3,500, $4,500). Capturing, jabbing, and tracking each wild Elanora koala is basically double that.', 'Two hours away, researchers at the University of the Sunshine Coast (UniSC) are doing their best to flatten the wave of disease too, with a separate vaccine.They inoculate about 2,000 koalas a year through wildlife hospital trials and tack themselves onto development projects or research studies in the region that involve their capture.They\'ve just wrapped a decade\'s-worth of those projects into one study of more than 600 animals – the largest and longest of its kind.Incredibly, deaths dropped by two thirds among vaccinated koalas.Molecular biologist Samuel Phillips tells the BBC about one local koala population they studied which was at risk of extinction. Authorities are now looking at translocating some animals so they don\'t overpopulate the area.""It turned it around completely.""And crucially, the study found that the koalas that did contract chlamydia were doing so later in life, after their peak breeding years had begun.', 'Dr Phillips and his research partner Peter Timms have now submitted their vaccine to the federal regulator for approval but say they\'re keeping their hopes in check.""There\'ll be hurdles,"" Dr Timms explains.In the meantime, for their small, overstretched team, dividing time and funding is an impossible balance. Do they involve themselves in as many trials as possible to help small groups of koalas now, or do they devote their efforts to advancing the tedious research and approval process which could help a huge cohort of them down the track?""People come to us semi-regularly and say, \'Can we vaccinate more koalas?\' And the answer at some point is \'No\', because otherwise we\'re just spending all our time and energy doing [that],"" Dr Timms says.', 'It has now been a decade since these two research teams first started seeing results, and there is still no real timeline on when a jab will be ready.And even when it is, there are huge barriers to any roll out.While making the vaccine isn\'t that costly, finding, capturing, and vaccinating wild koalas is extraordinarily expensive and time-consuming.Dr Phillips says they would have to strategically target select populations, though they\'re not yet sure how many koalas in each they\'d need to treat to reverse decline. That challenge will be doubly complicated with the QUT vaccine, though, because it requires two doses, as opposed to UniSC\'s single-shot formula.The QUT team has been developing an implant – inspired by a human contraceptive device – that dissolves after four weeks to provide the booster. It will be trialled on Currumbin\'s captive koalas next year.Then there is the question of funding, which has been, and continues to be, fickle. Both vaccine developers provide their shots to wildlife hospitals and research trials for free, relying on individual donors, generosity from their universities, and the unpredictable whims of election cycles.State and federal governments are the biggest financial backers of the vaccine projects – last year Canberra gave QUT and UniSC A$750,000 each.""No-one wants to imagine an Australia without koalas,"" Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said at the time.', 'But government contributions are random, and never quite enough.""I cannot believe somebody will not come along tomorrow and say \'You need to vaccinate? Here\'s my cheque to cover the next 10 years\'. But we can\'t find them,"" Dr Timms says.However, the biggest barrier is the mountain of red tape researchers are yet to cut through.Both groups have conservation charities and wildlife hospitals knocking down the door, desperate for access, but until they go through the ""painful"" approval process, their hands are largely tied.""[It\'s] a critical step that is just taking too long. It kills me,"" Dr Payne says.""We\'ve kind of passed it being urgent. It was urgent probably 10 years ago.""Adding to their despondency, is a fact all involved stress repeatedly: the vaccine is simply not enough to save the species.And so even the lucky koalas like Joe Mangy, who dodge death by chlamydia and return to the wild, still must face off against a myriad of other mortal threats.""It\'s death by a thousand cuts, right?"" Dr Timms says.']"
Georgia's outgoing president refuses to quit as successor sworn in,9 hours ago,George Wright & Sofia Ferreira Santos,BBC News,"['Thousands of Georgians protested in the capital Tbilisi as a new president allied with the ruling Georgian Dream party was inaugurated.Mikheil Kavelashvili, a former pro-footballer, has been sworn in during a critical political period for the country after the government suspended its application to join the European Union. Georgian Dream won parliamentary elections in October, but the victory was mired in allegations of fraud which have since sparked several street protests.Outgoing president Salome Zourabichvili refused to step down on Sunday, saying she was the ""only legitimate president"".', 'Addressing crowds gathered outside, Zourabichvili said she would leave the presidential palace but branded her successor illegitimate.""This building was a symbol only as long as a legitimate president was sitting here,"" she said.A few minutes\' walk away, Kavelashvili was sworn in at a closed-doors ceremony in parliament, where he was accompanied by his family. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze also attended the inauguration.Speaking after taking the oath, Kavelashvili went on to praise Georgian ""traditions, values, national identity, the sanctity of the family, and faith"".""Our history clearly shows that, after countless struggles to defend our homeland and traditions, peace has always been one of the main goals and values for the Georgian people,"" he said.', 'Georgia\'s four main opposition groups have rejected Kavelashvili and boycotted parliament. Kavelashvili is a former MP with the Georgian Dream party and was the only candidate for the job. Zourabichvili has previously denounced his election as a travesty. Zourabichvili: Georgia\'s pro-West president refusing to step downGeorgian Dream has become increasingly authoritarian in recent years, passing Russian-style laws targeting media and non-government groups who receive foreign funding, and the LGBT community.It refused to join Western sanctions on Russia after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and called the West the ""global war party"", making a mockery of its stated aim of joining the EU and Nato.An overwhelming majority of Georgians back the country\'s path to the EU and it is part of the constitution.But in November, the country\'s ruling party said the government would not seek EU accession talks until 2028.The announcement sparked days of protests, and riot police used tear gas and water cannon against protesters, who fought back by throwing fireworks and stones.On Saturday, protesters waving Georgian and EU flags gathered again ahead of the inauguration, forming a human chain that spanned kilometres.""I am out in the street together with my whole family trying somehow to tear out this small country out of the claws of the Russian empire,"" one protester told the Associated Press.', 'The US this week imposed sanctions on Georgia\'s former prime minister and billionaire founder of Georgian Dream, Bidzina Ivanishvili.Georgia is a parliamentary democracy with the president the head of state, and the prime minister the head of parliament.When Zourabichvili became president in 2018 she was endorsed by Georgian Dream, but she has since condemned their contested election victory in late October as a ""Russian special operation"" and backed nightly pro-EU protests outside parliament.Additional reporting from Nino Shonia in Tbilisi.']"

Three migrants die attempting to cross Channel,3 hours ago,Nick Johnson,BBC News,"['Three people have died attempting to cross the English Channel in a small boat on Sunday morning, the French coastguard says.People ended up in the water after trying to board a boat off the coast of Sangatte, near Calais, at about 06:00 local time (05:00 GMT). The three people later declared dead were recovered from the water by helicopter, while a further 45 were given treatment on the beach, many suffering from hypothermia. Four were taken to hospital.It has been the deadliest year on record for Channel crossings.', 'Dame Angela Eagle, minister for border security and asylum, said lives had been lost because ""ruthless criminals running the small boat trade are overloading people into unseaworthy vessels"".She said the government was ""committed to smashing these gangs"" and was supporting the French authorities.""It never stops,"" the mayor of Sangatte Guy Allemand told AFP. ""It\'s crossing after crossing, without any let-up.""He said seven people had needed intensive care after the incident.The French coastguard said a search was ongoing at sea for any other survivors.The Home Office confirmed there had been an incident in French waters, with French authorities leading the response and investigation.  Pierre-Henri Dumont, MP for the Pas-de-Calais region, told the BBC: ""Any attempt to cross the Channel in this way is very, very dangerous - but at this time of year, it is even more deadly.""He said rescue teams can respond quickly, but current temperatures mean ""spending even a few minutes in the water"" can be fatal.The incident follows four days in which 1,485 people made the journey, meaning it has been the busiest Christmas period since records began in 2018.More than 36,000 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year, surpassing the 2023 total of 29,437, government figures suggest. The International Organization for Migration (IOM), a UN agency which tracks the number of people who die crossing the Channel, says 77 people have died attempting to make the journey this year.A number of other boats were reported to have departed from the coast on Sunday, the French coastguard said in its statement.']"

Trump sides with tech bosses in Maga fight over immigrant visas,19 hours ago,Mike Wendling,BBC News,"['President-elect Donald Trump appeared to side with technology bosses Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy in a row over a visa programme that brings skilled workers to the US.Trump told the New York Post on Saturday that he ""always liked"" H-1B visas and hired guest workers under the scheme - even though he\'s previously been critical of the programme.He was wading into a debate that has pitted his advisors from the tech world against Republicans who want a harder line on all forms of immigration.The argument broke out after Ramaswamy, tapped by Trump along with Musk to slash government spending, blamed American culture for US firms deciding to hire skilled workers from other countries.', '""Our American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence,"" Ramaswamy wrote in a long X post that argued that foreign workers improve the US economy.""A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian [the top student in a class], will not produce the best engineers,"" he wrote.The post attracted backlash from anti-immigrant Trump supporters, and Ramaswamy later clarified that he believed ""the H-1B system is badly broken & should be replaced"".After the argument raged online for days, Trump told the Post: ""I\'ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favour of the visas. That\'s why we have them."" ""I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I\'ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It\'s a great program,"" he said.Trump moved to restrict access to the H-1B programme during his first term. Both the president-elect and his running mate JD Vance have been critical of the visas in the past, although Vance has close ties to the tech world and in his previous career as a venture capitalist funded start-ups that hired workers with H-1B visas.Ramaswamy\'s assertions led to a full-blown row online over the holidays, as mainstream Republicans and far-right influencers joined in criticising him and other wealthy figures in Trump\'s inner circle.""If we are going to have a throwdown, let\'s have it now,"" prominent Trump supporter Steve Bannon said on his War Room podcast on Friday. He went on to call the Republican claims of support of the H-1B programme a ""total scam"".Ramaswamy\'s perceived view of skilled worker visas was backed by Elon Musk, the X, Tesla and SpaceX boss selected to co-direct Trump\'s proposed ""Department of Government Efficiency"".Musk defended the H-1B visa programme as attracting the ""top ~0.1%"" of engineering talent"".""Thinking of America as a pro sports team that has been winning for a long time and wants to keep winning is the right mental construct,"" he wrote.Critics online posted screenshots of job postings at Musk\'s companies filled by people with H1-B visas, showing salaries of $200,000 and much less, and argued these hires did not constitute an elite talent pool but rather a way to hold down the wages of US-born workers.Musk then shot back at ""contemptible fools"", saying he was referring to ""those in the Republican Party who are hateful, unrepentant racists"".""They will absolutely be the downfall of the Republican Party if they are not removed,"" he wrote. He later swore at one of his critics and said he would ""go to war"" to defend the visa programme. Nikki Haley, Trump\'s former ambassador to the United Nations and a former Republican presidential candidate, became a prominent voice arguing against Ramaswamy and Musk.""There is nothing wrong with American workers or American culture,"" she wrote in response on X. ""All you have to do is look at the border and see how many want what we have. We should be investing and prioritizing in Americans, not foreign workers.""Haley, who like Ramaswamy was born to Indian immigrants, was joined in opposing the visa programme by far-right accounts online.Laura Loomer, an anti-Islam activist who regularly spreads conspiracy theories but is also known for her unwavering support of Trump, led the online charge with posts viewed millions of times.Earlier in the week, Loomer criticised Trump\'s choice of Sriram Krishnan, an India-born entrepreneur, as the White House senior advisor on artificial intelligence. Loomer wrote that Krishnan was a ""career leftist"" who is ""in direct opposition to Trump\'s America First agenda"".Cheered on by far-right X accounts, she also called Indian immigrants ""invaders"" and directed racist tropes at Krishnan.Loomer then accused Musk, who owns X, of ""censorship"" for allegedly restricting replies to her posts on the network and removing her from a paid premium programme. Echoing criticisms of Trump about the influence of the X boss, she wrote: ""\'President Musk\' is starting to look real… Free speech is an illusion.""On Friday and Saturday, a number of other conservative and far-right accounts also complained that the reach of their messages had been throttled on X. Laura Loomer: Who is conspiracy theorist travelling with Trump?The number of H-1B visas issued is capped at 65,000 per year plus an additional 20,000 for people with a master\'s from US institutions.Recent research by Boundless, an immigration consultancy, indicates that around 73% of the H-1B visas are issued to Indian nationals, with 12% issued to Chinese citizens. Trump promised that mass deportations of undocumented immigrants will start immediately after he takes office. In recent days the president-elect also denied that he\'s unduly under the influence of Musk and the other billionaires who backed his campaign.On Sunday, Trump told a conservative conference in Arizona that he was not under Musk\'s thumb.""You know, they\'re on a new kick,"" he told the crowd at AmericaFest, organised by Turning Point USA. ""All the different hoaxes. The new one is that President Trump has ceded the presidency to Elon Musk.""""No, no, that\'s not happening,"" he said. ""He\'s not gonna be president.""']"

"UK and EU look to 2025 for reset, but with little room for trade-offs",15 hours ago,Katya Adler,Europe Editor,"[""Early in 2025, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has been invited to an informal summit of EU leaders. It's the first such invitation for the UK since the bitter days of the Brexit negotiations.The focus of the February meeting is future security and defence co-operation. The backdrop: the volatile state of the world from Europe's perspective. Wars rage in the Middle East and in Europe - with Russia aided in its assault on Ukraine by Iran, North Korea and China.Adding to the uncertainty haunting this continent, Donald Trump is poised to re-enter the White House. He threatens Western cohesion with his pledge to slap punitive tariffs on imports - a big worry to the EU and the UK - and to potentially walk away from Nato, the transatlantic defence alliance Europeans have relied on for security, since its founding after World War Two."", 'These threats to security and to trade revenues have helped remind the EU and the UK of the common values they share in unpredictable times. The EU felt weakened by Brexit in 2016. It meant losing a big economy and its only significant military power apart from France. As for post-Brexit UK, now free from the rules of EU membership, it\'s also now a far smaller power on the world stage. And, closer to home, the Labour government has realised Europe is key to delivering on a number of priority pledges to the UK public.""The economy, defence, migration... there\'s a European element to all of this, making EU relations important for the whole government agenda. Things which will make a success of this government are tied up with Europe,"" says Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations.Labour has repeatedly promised an ""ambitious reset"" of EU-UK relations. There has been lots of shuttle diplomacy and symbolism since it won the general election in the summer.Foreign Secretary David Lammy attended a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers, Chancellor Rachel Reeves gave a speech at a summit of EU finance ministers, and the prime minister popped over to Brussels for a sit-down with EU Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen.', 'But what does this ""reset"" really mean? What can we expect in 2025? Might the UK government allow some freedom of movement in exchange for economic benefits on EU trade?An EU-UK summit is planned for spring, and a number of political figures and high-level diplomats from EU member states and the UK spoke to me on condition of anonymity ahead of bilateral negotiations getting started.I kept hearing of the ""enormous amount of goodwill"" in the EU towards the new Labour government with its oft-repeated ""reset"" enthusiasm. At the same time though, there is a clear note of Brussels scepticism the Labour government would do well to take heed of, if it wants to see tangible results.""The headspace is there. The appetite is there in Europe for closer UK relations,"" one EU figure told me. ""What\'s less clear is what London is really interested in - and what trade-offs it\'s willing to make to get there. That\'s key and that appears not to have been bottomed out in London yet.""', 'The defence and security arrangement I have mentioned is the proverbial ""low-hanging fruit"" as far as an EU-UK reset is concerned.It\'s relatively easy to formalise what is already happening: co-operation over Russia sanctions for example, as well as discussions - already taking place inside Nato - over military and defence capabilities and how to best protect Europe against cyber-attacks and attacks on key installations like energy infrastructure in the North Sea. It\'s seen as a win-win agreement. And there is no proposal to make a defence pact legally binding. The Labour government does not have to worry here about being seen - by the political opposition or those in the UK who voted Leave - as attempting to ""roll back Brexit"".  And it is sensitive about this potential accusation.But Labour has also made promises on trade and the economy: to ""make Brexit work"" and to ""tear down"" the trade barriers hard Brexit imposed. The Office for Budget Responsibility reckons Brexit will cost the UK economy 4% of GDP in the long term. Labour wants to avoid that, but that\'s not as straightforward as it might sound.', 'EU figures say they\'re confused by the UK government proclaiming an ""ambitious"" reset while insisting on maintaining restrictive post-Brexit red lines.A recent working paper setting out EU interests noted there were ""limited economic gains on offer"" because of the UK ruling out rejoining the EU\'s customs union or single market or accepting the free movement of people.Some in the EU suspect the UK government believes it can get a quid pro quo on trade for defence. That they say, is never going to happen.""The UK is mistaken if it thinks it can use an agreement on defence as a backdoor to getting sweet deals with us on trade,"" an EU diplomat told me.""For us, it\'s like being in a weird tug of war. With the devil on one EU shoulder and an angel on the other. In terms of values, there is more that unites us than divides us with the UK. ""The EU wants to take action to get the UK closer, but on the other hand, we can\'t do away with technical minutiae that are the foundation of the EU. We can\'t make special deals, even if that limits the relationship with the UK.""In order to see significant improvement in economic relations, both sides will have to make compromises.In Brussels, there is no appetite to rip up the TCA - the already-existing trade agreement between the EU and UK. But you do detect an EU openness to starting negotiations on different economic sectors simultaneously. ""We can walk and chew gum at the same time,"" insisted one EU diplomat.There\'s also an acknowledgement on the UK side that sectoral agreements might well have to involve aligning with EU rules in those sectors.', 'The key to any compromise that Labour might make with the EU going forward will be: Can they sell the result back home as a win for the British public?The EU will push hard for long term fishing rights in UK waters.It also wants a Youth Mobility Scheme, allowing 18-30 year olds to work and/or study in the UK or the EU for up to three years, paying local fees at university if they choose the study option.The UK government insists there will be no return to freedom of movement with the EU. Migration is a hot button issue. But it\'s notable that Labour has not explicitly ruled out the youth scheme. They\'ve only said they\'ve ""no plans"" to go for it.On youth mobility, the assumption is that more EU youngsters would take advantage of a mobility scheme than UK citizens because of language barriers.', 'But the UK government might use openness to the EU-requested mobility scheme and/or a fishing agreement as leverage to negotiate something important for UK interests, such as the mutual recognition of professional qualifications, which eases cross-Channel business, or the mobility of UK artists and entertainers to travel in the EU. Both of these were listed in the Labour election manifesto as priorities if the party got into government.Labour also wants to move on a veterinary agreement with the EU, to reduce barriers in the trade of food and agricultural products. That would require UK alignment with EU animal and plant health rules.', ""The EU and UK are both interested in better co-operation and coordination on energy and climate. Sir Keir also labelled this a priority.Linking carbon emissions trading schemes, as the EU does with a number of other countries, would mean the UK avoiding EU carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) implications - a cost feared by UK businesses.And removing post-Brexit blockages on the electricity market would deliver €44bn (£36bn) in savings to EU and UK consumers by 2040 and reduce investment costs in North Sea wind by 16%, according to Baringa business consultancy.The North Sea basin comprises the UK plus EU member states Belgium, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands and Single Market member Norway. It's one of the most promising regions in the world for offshore wind.On illegal migration, the EU says it's open to co-operating more closely with the UK. It wants the UK to crack down more on people working illegally in the country.  France complains that the ease with which it says irregular migrants can disappear and make a living is a major a pull-factor to the UK for economic migrants. The EU has ruled out the UK being able to send migrants, arriving illegally on its shores aboard small boats, back to the EU countries they set off from."", 'Whatever the developments in EU-UK relations in 2025 and beyond, they are likely to happen slowly because of political concerns and because negotiations have a habit of getting bogged down in detail.In direct contrast, a recent poll by YouGov and Datapraxis for the European Council of Foreign Relations suggests voters in the EU and UK are far more gung-ho than leaders in Brussels and London about jumping over previous political taboos to strengthen ties.The poll found that around half of those asked in the UK believe greater engagement with the EU is the best way to boost the UK economy (50%), strengthen its security (53%) and effectively manage migration (58%). When asked who the UK government should prioritise relations with, 50% choose Europe and only 17% the US. A huge 68% of respondents in Britain see a benefit in reintroducing cross-Channel freedom of movement in exchange for access to the European single market.The desire for co-operation, and willingness to forgo previous red lines, is also reciprocated in Europe. A majority of voters in Poland (54%) and Germany (53%) – and a prevailing opinion in Spain (43%), Italy (42%) and France (41%) – believe the EU should grant the UK special access to certain parts of the European single market to secure a closer security-based relationship.Geopolitical threats and uncertainties appear to be shifting public opinion dramatically. Will the political class in the UK and EU choose to keep up?']"
Growth of women in power grinds to near-halt in a mega-election year,15 hours ago,"Vibeke Venema, Stephanie Hegarty and Leoni Robertson",BBC 100 Women,"[""Nearly half the world's population - 3.6 billion people - had major elections in 2024, but it was also a year that saw the slowest rate of growth in female representation for 20 years.Twenty-seven new parliaments now have fewer women than they did before the elections - countries such as the US, Portugal, Pakistan, India, Indonesia and South Africa. And, for the first time in its history, fewer women were also elected to the European Parliament.The BBC has crunched numbers from 46 countries where election results have been confirmed and found that in nearly two-thirds of them the number of women elected fell.The data is from the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) - a global organisation of national parliaments that collects and analyses election data."", 'There were gains for women in the UK, Mongolia, Jordan and the Dominican Republic, while Mexico and Namibia both elected their first female presidents.However, losses in other places mean that the growth this year has been negligible (0.03%) - after having doubled worldwide between 1995 and 2020.', 'Mariana Duarte Mutzenberg, who tracks gender statistics for the IPU, says progress has been ""too fragile"" in certain democracies. For example, the Pacific Island nation Tuvalu lost its only female member of parliament, and now has no women in government at all.', 'The Pacific Islands have the lowest proportion of female members of parliament in the world at 8%.Globally, women make up 27% of parliaments worldwide, and only 13 countries are close to 50%. Latin America and parts of Africa are currently leading when it comes to female representation.Some countries, says Ms Duarte Mutzenberg, are still making gains, largely thanks to gender quotas - Mongolia jumped from 10% to 25% female representation this year, after introducing a mandatory 30% candidate quota for women.On average, countries without quotas have elected 21% women, compared with 29% with quotas.For example, quotas - and political will - helped Mexico achieve gender parity in 2018, after former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador decided the parliament should be 50% women.', 'Political will could also be a game-changer when it comes to ministerial positions, says Julie Ballington from UN Women - which collects data on women heading government ministries.Cabinets have the power to impact society, yet still have the lowest female representation of all the political measures UN Women looks at, she says, with women usually restricted to certain ministerial roles such as overseeing human rights, equality, and social affairs - rather than finance or defence.This is ""a missed opportunity"", she says.', 'With so many different countries, contexts and political intricacies at play it is hard to define why the dial hardly shifted this year.But there are some universal barriers to women\'s participation in politics.Firstly, research has shown there is an ambition gender gap.""Women are less likely to wake up and think they would be good in senior leadership,"" professor of politics Rosie Campbell told an audience at King\'s College, London. ""They often need to be nudged: \'Have you thought about being an MP?\'""And a slow-down could mean fewer mentors for future female politicians, says Dr Rachel George, an expert on gender and politics at Stanford University in the US. So young women would be ""less likely to think that they can, or should, run"".Once they do decide to run for office, women tend to be at a disadvantage financially.A wealth of research has found it is harder for women to access funding for a political campaign or to have the financial freedom to take time off work.In most societies, women still have more caring responsibilities than men - which can negatively affect how they are viewed by voters, says Dr George.This is not helped by the fact that few parliaments offer maternity leave, says Carlien Scheele from the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). ""It puts women off if those policies are not in place,"" she says.', 'And then, there is the way electoral systems are designed.Countries using proportional representation (PR) or mixed electoral systems elect a higher share of women than first-past-the-post systems and are also more likely to have electoral quotas for women, according to the IPU.But those factors are not new. So what is changing?There has been an increase in attacks on women in public life, online and in person, according to studies in many different countries. In Mexico, which already experiences violent elections, gender-based violence was particularly high this year, says IPU\'s Mariana Duarte Mutzenberg, with women politicians also particularly targeted by disinformation aimed at ""trying to ruin their reputation in one way or another"".This all has a wider ""chilling effect"" and stops younger women from wanting to run, says Dr George.', 'A backlash to female economic empowerment and feminism is also a factor.In South Korea - despite a small increase in the share of women elected - a feeling among many young men of reverse discrimination played out in this year\'s election.""Some parties continued to fuel or tap into an anti-gender sentiment among male voters who perceive women\'s rights advocates as anti-men,"" says Ms Duarte Mutzenberg.However, she says, this may have led to even more women coming out to vote.', 'So why does it all matter?Basic fairness aside, equal parliaments could improve national economies, says EIGE\'s Carlien Scheele, citing research showing gender diverse groups make better decisions, and gender-mixed boards lead to higher profits.Studies have also shown the benefits of including women in peace negotiations, suggesting that processes which are based on substantive contributions from women are more likely to achieve sustainable outcomes.""When women are in the room, peace deals are more likely to happen and more likely to last,"" says Dr George.Julie Ballington from UN Women says she would encourage people to think about women in politics differently.""It\'s not the under-representation of women. It\'s the over-representation of men.""', 'Additional data analysis by Rebecca Wedge-Roberts from BBC VerifyDesign by Raees Hussain']"

I took off my uniform, left my weapons, and started to make my way to my village in Tartous,"" he said.At around the same time, Mohammed Ramadan was at a position on the outskirts of the capital, Damascus.""There was no one to give orders to us. Many of our commanders fled before us. So I thought, why should I die and fight for someone who didn\'t even give me enough of a salary to be able to feed my family?""For our daily rations as soldiers we got just one egg and one potato.""The next morning, he also left his position and went home.The testimony of the soldiers provides an insight into the rapid collapse of ousted President Bashar al-Assad\'s regime.', ""The abandoned homes of Assad's ruthless enforcersJeremy Bowen: Can Syria's new ruler keep his promises?"", 'For many of his demoralised and poorly paid forces on the ground, the speed at which their defence disintegrated in the face of the rebel offensive did not come as a surprise.Many soldiers told us they were paid less than $35 (£28) a month and had to do other jobs to get by in a country where that would only cover a fraction of basic living costs.', 'Mohammed Ramadan was clutching the Kalashnikov rifle he\'d been previously assigned when we met him and several others in Damascus more than two weeks after the regime fell, at a ""reconciliation centre"" run by HTS.At the centre, former military, police and intelligence officers, as well as anyone who was part of pro-Assad militia groups, can register for a temporary civilian identity card and deposit their weapons.HTS has announced a general amnesty for those who worked for the former regime.', 'Waleed Abdrabuh, a member of the group looking after the reconciliation centres in Damascus, said: ""The goal is to have the weapons issued by the former regime to be returned to the state. And for the members of the forces to get a civilian ID so that they can be re-integrated into society.""Under Assad, conscription into the army was mandatory for adult males. Conscripts had to hand in their civilian IDs and were given military IDs instead.Without a civilian ID it would be hard to get a job or move around freely in the country, which partly explains why tens of thousands have showed up at centres in various cities.', 'At the centre in Damascus, formerly an office of Assad\'s Baath Party, hundreds of men were thronging to the gate, hankering to be let in.Many of them were keen to distance themselves from the crimes of the regime.""I didn\'t participate in any of their bad deeds. I consider them despicable acts. I did everything to avoid being a part of massacres and crimes against Syrians,"" Mohammed al-Nadaf said.""I even tried to leave the military twice because I knew I was on the wrong side. But it was not possible to escape. The military had all my civilian documents.""', 'Somar al-Hamwi, who served in the military for 24 years, said: ""Most people don\'t know anything, OK?

He left all these people, all of us military to our own destiny,"" said Somar.', 'There were many worried faces among the crowds at the reconciliation centre, but the environment appeared relatively amicable despite the 13-year civil war that left more than half a million people dead.""Everyone told me it is safe, and to go and make a settlement at the centre. The safety assurance made by HTS has made a big difference,"" said Mohammed al-Nadaf.But from different parts of Syria, reports of suspected revenge attacks involving killing, kidnapping and arson are increasingly coming in. There are no reliable statistics confirming how many attacks have taken place but dozens have been reported on social media.In the past week, three judges who arbitrated property-related matters in the previously regime-controlled town of Masyaf in north-western Syria - Mounzer Hassan, Mohammed Mahmoud and Youssef Ghanoum - were killed. Sources from the hospital where their bodies were examined have told the BBC they were struck in the head by a sharp object.We went to Alamerea village to visit the home of Mounzer Hassan. It was bare, cold, and looked like it needed repairs.', 'Mounzer\'s wife, Nadine Abdullah, told us she believed her husband was targeted because he was an Alawite - the minority sect from which the Assad family originates, and to which many of the former regime\'s political and military elite belonged.""Since they were civil, not criminal court judges, I think they were killed simply because they were Alawites. All Alawites did not benefit from Bashar al-Assad. Those who worked for the regime were forced to follow orders, otherwise brutal measures would be imposed on them,"" Nadine said.Mounzer\'s brother Nazir said: ""This is a crime against an innocent person. It\'s unacceptable. Those being killed had no connection to the politics of the regime. They were just working to support their poor families.""Mounzer was the father of four young children, and was the only wage earner in his family, also looking after his ailing father and brother.His family said they were speaking out because they want such deaths prevented in future.', '""Everyone says HTS did not commit the crime. But as the governing authority now, they must find out who did it. They have to ensure protection for all of us,"" Nadine said.HTS\'s interim government has condemned the killing of the judges and said it will find the perpetrators. It has also denied being involved in any reprisal killings.Protests were held in Masyaf following the killing of the judges, and many Alawites have told the BBC they are now worried for their safety.While HTS has announced an amnesty for Assad\'s forces, they have also said those involved in torture and killing will be held to account. That will be a difficult balance to strike.A few weeks since the fall of the regime, it is a delicate moment for Syria.Additional reporting by Aamir Peerzada and Sanjay Ganguly.']"
A year of extreme weather that challenged billions,15 hours ago,Esme Stallard,"Climate and science reporter, BBC News","['Climate change has brought record-breaking heat this year, and with it extreme weather, from hurricanes to month-long droughts.This year is expected to be the hottest on record, and new research shows that people around the world experienced an additional 41 days of dangerous heat due to climate change.Researchers from the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group at Imperial College and Climate Central said the study shows ""we are living in a dangerous new era"".From Brazil to Indonesia we take a look back at the climate events that affected the lives of billions in 2024.', 'This was a year of heat - temperature records were broken on land and in the sea multiple times. Marine life suffers in super-heated oceansIn April dozens of countries, from Lebanon in the west to Cambodia in the east, suffered a prolonged heatwave, bringing the risk of dehydration and heat stroke. But Julie Arrighi, director of programmes at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, said that the impacts are not felt equally.""Young people and those over 65 particularly those with pre-existing health conditions [are at risk] - they are physiologically less able to cope with extreme heat,"" she said. She said people in conflict settings also suffered disproportionately because of their housing situations, including living in temporary shelters, which can magnify heat, or a disrupted water system.Research has shown that populations over time can adjust to higher temperatures, but even taking this into account scientists at WWA and Climate Central estimate in 2024 the world\'s populations experienced 41 additional days of dangerous heat - compared to a world without climate change.Dr Friederike Otto, lead of WWA and Senior Lecturer in Climate Science at Imperial College London, said: ""The impacts of fossil fuel warming have never been clearer or more devastating than in 2024. ""We are living in a dangerous new era - extreme weather caused unrelenting suffering.""', 'A regional heatwave around the Amazon region was made worse by a natural climate phenomenon called El Niño, but the researchers at the WWA and Climate Central said that climate change remained the driving force.Coupled with higher temperatures, rainfall was also reduced across part of South America. Officials in Colombia reported that levels in the Amazon river were reduced by 90% severely affecting power supply, crop yield and leading to wildfires.Nearly half a million children are thought to have been affected as schools in Brazil and Colombia were closed due to a lack of drinking water, according to Unicef. The Amazon river is also an important lifeline for the rainforest of the same name - which provides support to thousands of species and supports the world\'s efforts to tackle climate change.""We fear [climate change ] might push the forest irreversibly to a drier state, leading to a reduction of moisture flow and carbon sink, as well as loss of biodiversity,"" said Dr Regina Rodrigues, professor of Physical Oceanography and Climate at Federal University of Santa Catarina in Brazil.""All these critical processes are essential not only locally and regionally but also globally in order to maintain life as we know it,"" she said.', 'While some suffer from a lack of rain, others got too much of it. The Philippines experienced a record-breaking six typhoons in just 30 days across October and November - this came after six months of storms. The country is one of the most vulnerable to these tropical storms because of its location close to warm ocean waters. Landslides and floods triggered by the storms this season killed more than 1,200 people across Southeast Asia.How is climate change affecting hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones?There is currently no evidence that climate change is increasing the number of typhoons, hurricanes or cyclones (the same phenomenon but named differently across the world), although research suggests it may be increasing their intensity. But an assessment of the season by WWA scientists concluded the record ocean temperatures that occurred in 2024 were ""conducive"" to the formation of such storms, and those temperatures have been enhanced by climate change.Dr Zach Zobel, associate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Centre, who was not involved in the study, supported the WWA approach but added: ""[This season] didn\'t tell us anything we didn\'t already know was coming in a 1.3-1.5C [warmer] world. ""Scientists have been warning about these extreme events becoming more frequent for years if not decades,"" he said.', 'Even the richest nations were not able to fully protect themselves from extreme weather this year. The US experienced two back-to-back hurricanes - first Hurricane Helene and then Hurricane Milton - which left more than 260 dead and $115bn (£92bn) worth of damage, according to research from Christian Aid. Scientists had predicted an ""extraordinary"" season because of the elevated ocean temperatures in the Atlantic, which fuel hurricanes.But while Hurricane Beryl was the Atlantic\'s earliest category five hurricane on record on 2 July, there was a lull in the middle of the season before Hurricane Helene hit. Dr Otto told the BBC that typically large storms can take heat out of the ocean preventing new hurricanes forming for some time, but qualitative evidence suggests  ""because the whole upper ocean was extremely hot this effect didn\'t happen.""She added the WWA is looking to undertake further analysis on this in the future.', 'Flooding in Sudan and Nigeria in August and September showed that extreme weather can be exacerbated by poorly maintained infrastructure.Heavy rains starting in July brought extensive flooding which led to several dam collapses killing dozens of people and forcing thousands from their homes.', 'The report from WWA and Climate Central estimates these heavy rainfall episodes have become common events due to human-caused warming, and are expected to occur on average every three to 10 years.Julie Arrighi from the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, said: ""Our studies continue to show the need to enhance preparedness for extreme weather to reduce loss of life and damages. ""We are not well prepared for life at 1.3-1.5°C of warming.""']"
"UK and EU look to 2025 for reset, but with little room for trade-offs",15 hours ago,Katya Adler,Europe Editor,"[""Early in 2025, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has been invited to an informal summit of EU leaders. It's the first such invitation for the UK since the bitter days of the Brexit negotiations.The focus of the February meeting is future security and defence co-operation. The backdrop: the volatile state of the world from Europe's perspective. Wars rage in the Middle East and in Europe - with Russia aided in its assault on Ukraine by Iran, North Korea and China.Adding to the uncertainty haunting this continent, Donald Trump is poised to re-enter the White House. He threatens Western cohesion with his pledge to slap punitive tariffs on imports - a big worry to the EU and the UK - and to potentially walk away from Nato, the transatlantic defence alliance Europeans have relied on for security, since its founding after World War Two."", 'These threats to security and to trade revenues have helped remind the EU and the UK of the common values they share in unpredictable times. The EU felt weakened by Brexit in 2016. It meant losing a big economy and its only significant military power apart from France. As for post-Brexit UK, now free from the rules of EU membership, it\'s also now a far smaller power on the world stage. And, closer to home, the Labour government has realised Europe is key to delivering on a number of priority pledges to the UK public.""The economy, defence, migration... there\'s a European element to all of this, making EU relations important for the whole government agenda. Things which will make a success of this government are tied up with Europe,"" says Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations.Labour has repeatedly promised an ""ambitious reset"" of EU-UK relations. There has been lots of shuttle diplomacy and symbolism since it won the general election in the summer.Foreign Secretary David Lammy attended a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers, Chancellor Rachel Reeves gave a speech at a summit of EU finance ministers, and the prime minister popped over to Brussels for a sit-down with EU Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen.', 'But what does this ""reset"" really mean? What can we expect in 2025? Might the UK government allow some freedom of movement in exchange for economic benefits on EU trade?An EU-UK summit is planned for spring, and a number of political figures and high-level diplomats from EU member states and the UK spoke to me on condition of anonymity ahead of bilateral negotiations getting started.I kept hearing of the ""enormous amount of goodwill"" in the EU towards the new Labour government with its oft-repeated ""reset"" enthusiasm. At the same time though, there is a clear note of Brussels scepticism the Labour government would do well to take heed of, if it wants to see tangible results.""The headspace is there. The appetite is there in Europe for closer UK relations,"" one EU figure told me. ""What\'s less clear is what London is really interested in - and what trade-offs it\'s willing to make to get there. That\'s key and that appears not to have been bottomed out in London yet.""', 'The defence and security arrangement I have mentioned is the proverbial ""low-hanging fruit"" as far as an EU-UK reset is concerned.It\'s relatively easy to formalise what is already happening: co-operation over Russia sanctions for example, as well as discussions - already taking place inside Nato - over military and defence capabilities and how to best protect Europe against cyber-attacks and attacks on key installations like energy infrastructure in the North Sea. It\'s seen as a win-win agreement. And there is no proposal to make a defence pact legally binding. The Labour government does not have to worry here about being seen - by the political opposition or those in the UK who voted Leave - as attempting to ""roll back Brexit"".  And it is sensitive about this potential accusation.But Labour has also made promises on trade and the economy: to ""make Brexit work"" and to ""tear down"" the trade barriers hard Brexit imposed. The Office for Budget Responsibility reckons Brexit will cost the UK economy 4% of GDP in the long term. Labour wants to avoid that, but that\'s not as straightforward as it might sound.', 'EU figures say they\'re confused by the UK government proclaiming an ""ambitious"" reset while insisting on maintaining restrictive post-Brexit red lines.A recent working paper setting out EU interests noted there were ""limited economic gains on offer"" because of the UK ruling out rejoining the EU\'s customs union or single market or accepting the free movement of people.Some in the EU suspect the UK government believes it can get a quid pro quo on trade for defence. That they say, is never going to happen.""The UK is mistaken if it thinks it can use an agreement on defence as a backdoor to getting sweet deals with us on trade,"" an EU diplomat told me.""For us, it\'s like being in a weird tug of war. With the devil on one EU shoulder and an angel on the other. In terms of values, there is more that unites us than divides us with the UK. ""The EU wants to take action to get the UK closer, but on the other hand, we can\'t do away with technical minutiae that are the foundation of the EU. We can\'t make special deals, even if that limits the relationship with the UK.""In order to see significant improvement in economic relations, both sides will have to make compromises.In Brussels, there is no appetite to rip up the TCA - the already-existing trade agreement between the EU and UK. But you do detect an EU openness to starting negotiations on different economic sectors simultaneously. ""We can walk and chew gum at the same time,"" insisted one EU diplomat.There\'s also an acknowledgement on the UK side that sectoral agreements might well have to involve aligning with EU rules in those sectors.', 'The key to any compromise that Labour might make with the EU going forward will be: Can they sell the result back home as a win for the British public?The EU will push hard for long term fishing rights in UK waters.It also wants a Youth Mobility Scheme, allowing 18-30 year olds to work and/or study in the UK or the EU for up to three years, paying local fees at university if they choose the study option.The UK government insists there will be no return to freedom of movement with the EU. Migration is a hot button issue. But it\'s notable that Labour has not explicitly ruled out the youth scheme. They\'ve only said they\'ve ""no plans"" to go for it.On youth mobility, the assumption is that more EU youngsters would take advantage of a mobility scheme than UK citizens because of language barriers.', 'But the UK government might use openness to the EU-requested mobility scheme and/or a fishing agreement as leverage to negotiate something important for UK interests, such as the mutual recognition of professional qualifications, which eases cross-Channel business, or the mobility of UK artists and entertainers to travel in the EU. Both of these were listed in the Labour election manifesto as priorities if the party got into government.Labour also wants to move on a veterinary agreement with the EU, to reduce barriers in the trade of food and agricultural products. That would require UK alignment with EU animal and plant health rules.', ""The EU and UK are both interested in better co-operation and coordination on energy and climate. Sir Keir also labelled this a priority.Linking carbon emissions trading schemes, as the EU does with a number of other countries, would mean the UK avoiding EU carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) implications - a cost feared by UK businesses.And removing post-Brexit blockages on the electricity market would deliver €44bn (£36bn) in savings to EU and UK consumers by 2040 and reduce investment costs in North Sea wind by 16%, according to Baringa business consultancy.The North Sea basin comprises the UK plus EU member states Belgium, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands and Single Market member Norway. It's one of the most promising regions in the world for offshore wind.On illegal migration, the EU says it's open to co-operating more closely with the UK. It wants the UK to crack down more on people working illegally in the country.  France complains that the ease with which it says irregular migrants can disappear and make a living is a major a pull-factor to the UK for economic migrants. The EU has ruled out the UK being able to send migrants, arriving illegally on its shores aboard small boats, back to the EU countries they set off from."", 'Whatever the developments in EU-UK relations in 2025 and beyond, they are likely to happen slowly because of political concerns and because negotiations have a habit of getting bogged down in detail.In direct contrast, a recent poll by YouGov and Datapraxis for the European Council of Foreign Relations suggests voters in the EU and UK are far more gung-ho than leaders in Brussels and London about jumping over previous political taboos to strengthen ties.The poll found that around half of those asked in the UK believe greater engagement with the EU is the best way to boost the UK economy (50%), strengthen its security (53%) and effectively manage migration (58%). When asked who the UK government should prioritise relations with, 50% choose Europe and only 17% the US. A huge 68% of respondents in Britain see a benefit in reintroducing cross-Channel freedom of movement in exchange for access to the European single market.The desire for co-operation, and willingness to forgo previous red lines, is also reciprocated in Europe. A majority of voters in Poland (54%) and Germany (53%) – and a prevailing opinion in Spain (43%), Italy (42%) and France (41%) – believe the EU should grant the UK special access to certain parts of the European single market to secure a closer security-based relationship.Geopolitical threats and uncertainties appear to be shifting public opinion dramatically. Will the political class in the UK and EU choose to keep up?']"

Israel forcibly evacuates Gaza hospital and detains medical staff,18 hours ago,BBC News,Member of BBC News. Name not available,"['Israeli forces have detained and interrogated medical staff after forcibly evacuating the last major hospital in northern Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry says.The director of Kamal Adwan Hospital, Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, was among those taken for questioning by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which accused him of ""being a Hamas terrorist operative"", without providing evidence.On Friday an estimated 50 people, including medical staff were killed in Israeli air strikes targeting the vicinity of the hospital,  the health ministry said.The IDF said it had carried out an operation there, alleging the hospital was a ""Hamas terrorist stronghold"".', 'Fifteen critical patients, 50 caregivers and 20 health workers were transferred the nearby Indonesian Hospital, the World Health Organization (WHO) said. The WHO said it was ""appalled by yesterday\'s raid"" on the hospital, which it said now meant the area\'s last major health facility was out of service.Eid Sabbah, head of the nursing department at Kamal Adwan, told the BBC the military had ordered the evacuation around 07:00 on Friday, giving the hospital about 15 minutes to move patients and staff into the courtyard.Israeli troops then entered the hospital and removed the remaining patients, he said.The IDF said it had ""facilitated the secure evacuation of civilians, patients and medical personnel"" before beginning the operation.The city of Beit Lahia, where the hospital is located, has been under a tightening Israeli blockade imposed on parts of northern Gaza since October.The UN has said the area has been under ""near-total siege"" as the Israeli military heavily restricts access of aid deliveries to an area where an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 people remain.In recent days, the hospital\'s administrators have issued desperate pleas appealing to be protected, as they say the facility has become a regular target for Israeli shelling and explosives.But the IDF and Israeli Security Agency (ISA) alleged that intelligence had shown ""terrorists"" were using the Kamal Adwan Hospital as a command centre for its military operations in Jabalia. In a statement on Saturday, the IDF said it apprehended 240 combatants. It said IDF officers were attacked during the operation and weapons were found and confiscated in the area of the hospital.It added Dr Abu Safiya was among medical staff taken for questioning and is ""suspected of being a Hamas terrorist operative, as well as Hamas engineering and anti-tank missile operatives.""Hamas has called on the United Nations to intervene to protect the remaining medical facilities in Gaza.""We also demand that UN observers be sent to these facilities in order to determine the truth of what is happening,"" it said in statement on Saturday.', 'Gaza\'s deputy minister of health, Dr Yousef Abu-Al Rish, told the BBC that around 100 medical staff were being questioned by the IDF and alleged that some were exposed to psychological torture.

Three dead in suspected Christmas cake poisoning,19 hours ago,Sofia Ferreira Santos,BBC News,"[""Arsenic has been found in the blood of one of three women who died after eating a Christmas cake in a suspected poisoning in Brazil, a police chief has told local media.The highly toxic substance was also identified in the blood test results of a 10-year-old boy and the woman who made the cake - both of whom are still in hospital.Five members of the same family fell ill after eating the cake at a gathering in Torres, in the southern Rio Grande do Sul state, on Monday afternoon.Police have sent the cake for testing, and said several out-of-date food items were also found during a search at the woman's house. They added that it is not yet clear whether the suspected poisoning was intentional."", 'Test results from the cake are expected to be available by next week, according to local media.On Friday, police requested for the body of a man - the late husband of the woman who made the cake - to be exhumed.

Police told Brazilian broadcasters that she is the only one believed to have eaten two slices of her homemade cake, and her tests returned the highest levels of arsenic.Speaking to local media, police chief Marcos Vinicius Veloso said some of the family members complained that the cake had a ""peppery"" taste.The family then began to experience symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhoea, and five of them sought medical help at the Nossa Senhora dos Navegantes Hospital at around 01:00 local time (04:00 GMT) on Tuesday.Hours later, two sisters died from cardiac arrest, the hospital said.

Did bird strike contribute to South Korea plane crash? What we know so far,,BBC News,Member of BBC News. Name not available,"['More than 170 people have died after a plane crashed as it was landing in South Korea on Sunday morning.The Jeju Air plane came off the runway before colliding with a wall at Muan International Airport in the south west of the country.The plane, which was returning from Bangkok, in Thailand, was carrying 181 people - 179 of whom have died, while two crew members were rescued from the wreckage.Authorities are investigating the cause of the crash, which fire officials have indicated may have occurred due to a bird strike and bad weather. However experts have warned the crash could have been caused by a number of factors.', 'The flight, 7C2216, was a Boeing 737-800 operated by Jeju Air, Korea\'s most popular budget airline.The plane arrived in Muan at about 09:00 local time (00:00 GMT).A South Korean transport official said that the plane had been attempting to land but was forced to hold off after air traffic control gave a bird strike warning - an alert about the risk of a collision with birds.About two minutes later, the pilot called in a Mayday and air traffic command gave permission for the plane to land from the opposite direction, the official said.One video appears to show the plane touching down without using its wheels or any other landing gear. It skidded down the runway and crashed into a wall before erupting into flames.A witness told the South Korean news agency Yonhap that they heard a ""loud bang"" followed by a ""series of explosions"".Videos from the scene show the plane ablaze with smoke billowing into the sky. Fire crews have since extinguished the fire.', 'Lee Jeong-hyun, the chief of the Muan fire department, told a televised briefing that the tail section of the plane was identifiable but ""one cannot recognise the shape of the rest of the plane"".He said that the bird strike and bad weather may have caused the crash - but that the exact cause is still being investigated. The flight and voice recorders from the plane have been recovered, though the Yonhap news agency reported that the former was damagedOne passenger on the flight messaged a relative, saying that a bird ""was stuck in the wing"" and that the plane could not land, local media reported.Officials, however, have not confirmed whether the plane did actually collide with any birds. The head of Jeju Air\'s management said that the crash was not due to ""any maintenance issues"", Yonhap reported.The South Korean transport department said that the head pilot on the flight had held the role since 2019 and had more than 6,800 hours of flight experience.Geoffrey Thomas, an aviation expert and editor of Airline News, told the BBC that South Korea and its airlines were considered ""industry best practice"" and that both the aircraft and the airline have an ""excellent safety record"".He added: ""A lot of things about this tragedy don\'t make sense.""', 'A bird strike is a collision between a plane in flight and a bird. They are very common - in the UK, there were more than 1,400 bird strikes reported in 2022, only about 100 of which affected the plane, according to data from the Civil Aviation Authority.The best known bird strike occurred in 2009, when an Airbus plane made an emergency landing on New York\'s Hudson River after colliding with a flock of geese. All 155 passengers and crew survived.Professor Doug Drury, who teaches aviation at CQUniversity Australia, wrote in an article for The Conversation this summer that Boeing planes have turbofan engines, which can be severely damaged in a bird strike. He said that pilots are trained to be especially vigilant during the early morning or at sunset, when birds are most active.But some aviation experts are sceptical about whether a bird strike could have caused the crash at Muan Airport.""Typically they [bird strike] don\'t cause the loss of an airplane by themselves,"" Mr Thomas told Reuters. Australian airline safety expert Geoffrey Dell also told the news agency: ""I\'ve never seen a bird strike prevent the landing gear from being extended.""', ""The plane was carrying 175 passengers and six crew. Two of the passengers were Thai and the rest are believed to have been South Korean, authorities have said. Many are thought to have been returning from a Christmas holiday in Thailand.The official death toll stands at 179 - making it the deadliest plane crash in South Korean history. All the passengers and four members of crew died.Authorities have so far identified at least 88 bodies.Five of the people who died were children under the age of 10. The youngest passenger was a three-year-old boy and the oldest was 78, authorities said, citing the passenger manifest.South Korea's National Fire Agency said two members of flight crew - a man and a woman - survived the crash. They were found in the tail side of the aircraft after the crash and taken to hospital, it said.More than 1,500 emergency personnel have been deployed as part of recovery efforts, including 490 fire employees and 455 police officers. They have been searching the area around the runway for parts of the plane and those who were onboard."", 'Acting President Choi Sang-mok has declared a special disaster zone in Muan, which makes central government funding available to the local government and victims.All flights to and from Muan International Airport have been cancelled.Families of the victims of the crash have been travelling to the airport in the hope of finding out what happened to their relatives. Video footage from Reuters shows officials reading names of the victims out loud.', ""Airport authorities and the Red Cross have set up more than a dozen tents in the airport for bereaved families to grieve in private. Sounds of crying echoed through the terminal. Some are frustrated at how long it is taking to identify the bodies.Jeju Air has apologised to families. Its chief executive said in a news conference that the airline had no history of accidents. It is believed that Sunday's crash has been the only fatal accident since the airline was launched in 2005."", 'Plane manufacturer Boeing has offered condolences to those affected.Choi, South Korea\'s acting president, said: ""I express my deepest condolences to the many victims in the incident.

179 people killed in deadliest plane crash in South Korea,4 hours ago,Frances Mao,,"[""All passengers and most of the crew on board a Jeju Air flight have died after the plane crash-landed at an airport in South Korea on Sunday.A total of 179 of the 181 people on board the Boeing 737-800 were killed, with just two survivors, both cabin staff, pulled from the burning wreckage.The plane landed at Muan International Airport in the country's south, skidding off the runway and crashing into a wall in a fiery explosion.Flight 2216 was returning from Bangkok, Thailand with six crew and 175 passengers, many of them holidaymakers.Distraught families gathered in the airport's arrival hall in tears, as they waited for bodies to be identified."", 'Some of those killed have only been identifiable by their fingerprints. Maeng Gi-su, 78, told the BBC his nephew and his nephew\'s two sons had been on the plane. It was the family\'s first trip abroad, to mark the youngest son finishing his college entrance exams.""I can\'t believe the entire family has just disappeared. My heart aches so much,"" he said.The passengers included 173 South Koreans and two Thai nationals. They were aged between 3 and 78, although most were in their 40s, 50s and 60s, South Korea\'s Yonhap News Agency reported.', ""Footage shared of the crash - which happened shortly after 09:00 local time (00:00 GMT) - showed the aircraft landing without wheels, overshooting the runway and crashing into the airport's perimeter wall, before it exploded into flames.An investigation into the cause is under way. There had been no initial reports of plane or maintenance problems at take-off.  South Korean transport officials are reporting the plane ran into difficulties approaching landing - with the pilot, who had more than 6,800 hours of flight experience - pulling out of the first attempt due to bird interference.Soon after, the pilot issued a mayday call and made the ill-fated emergency landing attempt. A malfunction with the landing gear may have arisen from birds getting caught in the plane's systems, local media reported.One passenger sent a relative a message saying a bird was stuck in the wing, the South Korean News1 agency said."", 'The disaster is a national tragedy for South Korea, which has been embroiled in a political crisis after President Yoon and his temporary successor were both impeached by parliament.Acting President Choi Sang-mok, who was only appointed on Friday, visited the site of the crash on Sunday. ""I express my deepest condolences to the many victims in the incident. I will do all I can for the injured to quickly recover,"" Choi said.South Korea\'s airlines have typically been seen as ""industry best practice"" with good safety records, analysts have said.The Jeju Air crash is the worst for any South Korean airline since the 1997 Korean Air crash in Guam, which killed more than 200 people. Prior to Sunday, the deadliest on South Korean soil was an Air China crash flight that killed 129.The Muan airport crash also marks the first fatal accident for Jeju Air, one of South Korea\'s largest low-cost airlines which was set up in 2005.Jeju Air bosses bowed deeply as they gave a public apology at a press conference on Sunday.""We deeply apologise to all those affected by the incident. We will make every effort to resolve the situation,"" the firm said in a statement.Boeing Airlines, which manufactured the 737-800 jet, has said it is in touch with the airline.']"

"As Putin reaches 25 years in power, has he 'taken care of Russia'?",,BBC News,Member of BBC News. Name not available,"['I will never forget New Year\'s Eve 1999.I was working as a producer in the BBC\'s Moscow bureau. Suddenly there was breaking news: Russia\'s President Boris Yeltsin had stepped down.His decision to resign took everyone by surprise, including the British press corps in Moscow. When the news broke there was no correspondent in the office. That meant I had to step in to write and broadcast my first BBC dispatch.""Boris Yeltsin always said he would see out his full term in office,"" I wrote. ""Today he told Russians he\'d changed his mind.""It was the start of my career as a reporter.And the start of Vladimir Putin\'s as Russia\'s leader.Following Yeltsin\'s resignation, in accordance with the Russian constitution, Prime Minister Putin became acting president. Three months later he won the election.On leaving the Kremlin, Yeltsin\'s parting instruction to Putin was: ""Take care of Russia!""', 'I\'ve found myself recalling these words of Yeltsin more and more, the closer Russia\'s war on Ukraine gets to the three-year mark.That\'s because President Putin\'s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has had devastating consequences.Primarily for Ukraine, which has seen massive destruction and casualties in its cities. Almost 20% of its territory has been occupied and 10 million of its citizens have been displaced.But for Russia, too:Since Vladimir Putin\'s decision to launch his so-called ""special military operation"" Russia has sustained heavy losses on the battlefieldRussian towns and cities come under regular drone attackUkrainian soldiers have occupied a part of Russia\'s Kursk regionInternational sanctions are heaping pressure on Russia\'s economyWhat\'s more, the country\'s demographic situation is direDomestic repression has picked up apaceI\'ve been reporting on Putin since he came to power a quarter of a century ago.On 31 December 1999, who would have thought that Russia\'s new leader would still be in power two and a half decades later? Or that Russia today would be waging war on Ukraine and facing off with the West?', 'I often wonder whether the course of history would have been drastically different if Yeltsin had picked someone else to succeed him. The question, of course, is academic. History is full of ifs and buts and maybes.One thing I can say with certainty: over twenty-five years I\'ve seen different Putins.And I\'m not the only one.""The Putin I met with, did good business with, established a Nato-Russia Council with, is very, very different from this almost megalomaniac at the present moment,"" former Nato chief Lord Robertson told me in 2023.""The man who stood beside me in May 2002, right beside me, and said Ukraine is a sovereign and independent nation state which will make its own decisions about security, is now the man who says that [Ukraine] is not a nation state.""I think that Vladimir Putin has a very thin skin and a huge ambition for his country. The Soviet Union was recognised as the second superpower in the world. Russia can\'t make any claims in that direction. And I think that ate away at his ego.""That is one possible explanation for the change we\'ve seen in Putin: his burning ambition to ""Make Russia Great Again"" (and to make up for what many perceive as Moscow\'s defeat in the Cold War) put Russia on an inevitable collision course with its neighbours – and with the West.The Kremlin has a different explanation. From the speeches he gives, the comments he makes, Putin appears driven by resentment, by an all-encompassing feeling that for years Russia has been lied to and disrespected, its security concerns dismissed by the West.But does Putin himself believe that he has fulfilled Yeltsin\'s request to ""take care of Russia?""I recently had a chance to find out.', 'More than four hours into his lengthy end-of-year press conference, Putin invited me to ask a question.""Boris Yeltsin told you to take care of Russia,"" I reminded the president. ""But what of the significant losses in your so-called \'special military operation\', the Ukrainian troops in Kursk region, the sanctions, the high inflation. Do you think you\'ve taken care of your country?""""Yes,"" President Putin replied. ""And I haven\'t just taken care of it. We\'ve pulled back from the edge of the abyss.""He portrayed Yeltsin\'s Russia as a country that had been losing its sovereignty. He accused the West of having ""patronisingly patted"" Yeltsin on the shoulder while ""using Russia for its own purposes"". But he, Putin, was ""doing everything"", he said, ""to ensure Russia was an independent sovereign state"".Presenting himself as the defender of Russian sovereignty: is this a view he\'s come up with retrospectively to try to justify the war in Ukraine? Or does Putin really believe this take on modern Russian history?I\'m still not sure. Not yet. But I sense that it is a key question.The answer to it may well influence how the war ends - and Russia\'s future direction.']"
